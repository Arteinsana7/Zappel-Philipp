## Description :
Project Title: Zappel-Phillip Learning Companion

Introduction:
Zappel-Phillip, the first neurodivergent character ever mentioned in literature, was portrayed as a young boy judged for being too distracted and lazy. Drawing inspiration from this character, we embarked on creating an application tailored for both neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals. Our aim is to facilitate the process of learning how to learn by incorporating pedagogical methods into our platform.

Features:

Structured Work Cycles: Utilize a chronometer or recall function to organize and manage working sessions effectively.
Customizable Folders: Create folders comprising videos, images, notes, and sound recordings, enabling users to seamlessly navigate through their materials.
Engaging Learning Curves: Implement playful learning curves designed to foster positive learning experiences.
Implementation:

Version 2 (V2): Incorporate a database to support Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, enhancing the application's functionality and usability.
